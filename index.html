        <h1>Esports</h1>

        <p>
          Esports, short for electronic sports, is a rapidly growing industry involving competitive video gaming.
          Depending on the type of game, top players (also called pro players) compete individually or as a team in
          leagues and tournaments. Such events are often held in stadiums or arenas, streamed online to viewers in
          their homes, and broadcast on television networks.
        </p>

        <p>
          The esports industry has attracted significant investment and sponsorships from traditional sports
          organizations, media companies, and popular consumer brands, further solidifying its position as a
          mainstream entertainment phenomenon. Some of these organizations include Red Bull, ESPN, and Cisco.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the game, the amount of game modes vary, but most include the option to play competitively or
          casually. Casual game modes are for players who want to enjoy the game without the pressure of winning or
          losing, while competitive game modes are for more serious players who strive to increase their rank and
          skills in the game.
